        <h2><span class="fancy">D</span>essa's Story</h2>
        <p>Combining wit, tenderness, and poetic sensibility to rare effect, Dessa spins delicate and charged stories and animates them with her expressive alto voice, arresting for its honest, clear simplicity. Transcending the restrictions of genre to reveal an astonishing multi-platform voice. Member of the Doomtree collective. Essayist. Rapper. Amaretto enthusiast. </p>
        <p>Dessa is a rapper, a singer, and an essayist with the Doomtree collective–the ascendant Minneapolis hip-hop crew. She’s landed on the Billboard Top 200 list as a solo artist (Parts of Speech) and as a Doomtree member (All Hands), and has made a career out of bucking traditional genre designations–rapping at Lollapalooza, arranging for full choir, and co-writing classical works for an orchestra. As a writer, she’s contributed to MPR, the Star Tribune, literary journals around the country, and has published two short collections of her own.</p>
        <p>Dessa is a founding member of The Boy Sopranos, an almost all-female a cappella group, with frequent collaborators Jessy Greene, Aby Wolf and others. She also taught at the Institute of Production and Recording and the McNally Smith College of Music. She was a contributing artist on the 2015 St. Paul based 'Plume Project." A public art installment in which images and colors were projected onto steam rising from a smoke stack in downtown St. Paul and music and spoken-word pieces could be accessed by calling a phone number. Dessa read her poem "Circle Games." In 2016, she had a flavor of ice cream named after her on July 27, 2016 by Izzy's Ice Cream, “Dessa’s Existential Crunch”.</p>
